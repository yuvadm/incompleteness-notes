# Incompleteness Notes

> Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them.

Complete notes in Hebrew for one of the best and worst courses I ever took: "Incompleteness and Undecidability in Formal Languages", by [Assaf Hasson](http://www.math.bgu.ac.il/~hassonas/index.html) at Ben-Gurion University.

Read and weep.
